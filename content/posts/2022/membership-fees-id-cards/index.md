If you need to pay your membership fees (which began August 2013), contact Michelle at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

If you need to update your information (phone, address, etc) or request a new card (due to expiration or loss), contact 2nd Chief Cheryl at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
