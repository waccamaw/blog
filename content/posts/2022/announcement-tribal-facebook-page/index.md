For all my Waccamaw friends, please remember to post to our FB business page, which says Community.

Our FB url is: https://www.facebook.com/WaccamawIndianPeople

We do not the own the Waccamaw Indian People page that says local business. Ours doesn't have dashes in the name or numbers after it like this: [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Waccamaw-Indian-People/163419077021621](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Waccamaw-Indian-People/163419077021621)

We only have one Facebook page.
