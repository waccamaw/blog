**WACCAMAW INDIAN PEOPLE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES**

We have been working with several organizations, Truman Parmele/Military Officers association and Marsha Griffin/Consultant HGTC, to provide educational opportunities for the Waccamaw Indian People and/or veterans.

These services could be of value to members, family or veterans wishing to complete high school, obtain a GED,  or pursue a career through a Technical or Community college degree programs.

If currently applying for jobs, there is assistance with resume writing and interview preparation.

There would be financial assistance to cover the costs in the form of scholarships and grants, plus rides to the education center, and other benefits.

If you or your family would like to discuss or pursue any of these opportunities please contact me
