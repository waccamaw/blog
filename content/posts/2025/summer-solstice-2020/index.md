From CoC Rick:



The summer solstice falls on June 20th the third Saturday of the month. I have spoken to two of our three fire-keepers and they both are in favor of holding the fire ceremony. Do not feel obligated to addend if you feel your health or the health of others may be at risk.For those who feel comfortable attending I look forward to seeing you there.Thanks COC
