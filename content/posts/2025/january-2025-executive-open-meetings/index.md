Due to inclement weather with a chance of ice and snow, the January 2025 executive session will be rescheduled for February. Discussions can take place via email before the February meeting.

The January 2025 open meeting will be via Zoom only. Please stay safe and warm and join us online for the meeting.

Walk easy.
