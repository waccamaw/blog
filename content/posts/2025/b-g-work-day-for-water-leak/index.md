# B&G Work Day for Water Leak

We have a water leak feeding the dance circle and campsites.

Chris said he try sometime this week to go out and dig up at the valve connections, so we will know what fittings we may need.

I'm calling for utility locations and line-up rental on a trencher.

The plan is to work sat and or sun to get the pipe in. If we get enough help maybe the gate too.

Tools that you may need are a shovel, hard toothrake, and post-hole diggers.

All help is appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your help.
