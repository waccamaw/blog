Updated: Mar 25

The Waccamaw Indian People are organizing a Youth Days Weekend, offering children an experience of our cultural heritage and the natural environment. The event, featuring a mix of traditional and outdoor activities, includes camping, fishing, making s'mores, and horseback riding. Children will participate in a scavenger hunt, enjoy storytelling, and collaborate with the Winyah Rivers Alliance for canoeing and kayaking. A significant aspect of the weekend is an interpretive trail walk, which provides educational insights into the local environment and the Waccamaw Indian People's historical ties to the land. The registration process now includes ages 9-17.

.Use the following link to register; limited space is available. Release of liability and photo release forms will be sent to the registrant.
