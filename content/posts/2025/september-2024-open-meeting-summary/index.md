She can invite people to a party, but she’s liable for it and needs here own insurance and waiver of liability with us

        259.

Need simple risk management

        260.

I think if she doesn’t have insurance, it comes back on us

        261.

They’d need to sign an agreement or property owner is liable

        262.

I agree with putting up “no trespassing” signs

        263.

I don’t want Jimmy to have to move; he’s been there a long time

        264.

We need to do something with the land and have them manage it

        265.

Emily: if you had something out there, you need insurance

        266.

Responsible agent: if she can’t afford insurance, we pay it

        267.

It’s essentially another life estate

        268.

We would still need insurance

        269.

Emily: why not have them pay a % of it

        270.

Chief Hatcher: if someone has an accident on the land in a hole that we didn’t fix, we have to pay

        271.

AC Cheryl: Renters insurance would work in this situation

        272.

Marion: I could talk to Leeand see how it works with a life estate

        273.

        275.

We care for sick people

        276.

Our family and grandkids live there

        277.

In the October meeting, we can make a decision once we have a better understanding

        278.

Chief Hatcher: if we keep it, we need to do something with it

        279.

Chief Hatcher: if we give you “no trespassing” signs, can you put them up?

        280.

Jimmy: they’re already up

        281.

Chief Hatcher: I want to have ou all taken care of

        282.

CoC  Susan: Let’s talk by internet

        283.

Marion: motion to pay the taxes for this year; Emily seconded

        284.

Emily and Marion suggested more discussion via the internet

        285.

Our family lives there

        286.

My Dad didn’t want us to not have a place to stay

        287.

Not sure who said I was trespassing

        288.

AC Cheryl: it’s just the legal term that applies to the life estate

        289.

Jimmy: yeah, just mother

        290.

We’ll give back the money you put into it

        291.

Only 2-3 people have been out there

        292.

Chief Hatcher: I don’t want you evicted

        293.

Two things: we keep the land; you manage it with the goal for tax-exempt status or sell it

        294.

Jimmy: you can’t sell it unless you dissolve the tribe

        295.

AC Cheryl: if Donna and Jimmy were the property managers, it could change to tax-expemt

        296.

Discuss it privately for a win-win

        297.

If sold, the life estate could  continue

        298.

We need to do something and make it tax-exempt

        299.

We’ve just got to be careful

        300.

Donna: your tribe is important to us

        301.

CoC  Susan: let’s do it by email

        302.

Marion: no one in the tribe has said you have to move people off the land

        303.

Marion: the only thing is the liability issue

        304.

Chief Hatcher: I think we should give them money for the trip up hre

        305.

Jimmy: put that money towards the taxes

        306.

Emily-yes, 2C Alan (Chris)-yes, Marion-yes, CoC  Susan-yes

        307.

Emimly: if a lawyer is needed; we can work it out

        308.

Suggest separate cut-offs for each campsite

        309.

Marion: he is going to put cut-offs on each valve

        310.

We need to get things done quicker

        311.

Glenn: all of this happened and I have knee trouble and wasn’t/ couldn’t  get up and down

        312.

I hadn’t heard from Chris

        313.

Glenn: doing the valves could take longer

        314.

Reclaiming lands, climate resilience

        315.

Historical mapping to be included

        318.

Larry: you have to have 4 Elders to vote on anything

        319.

Chief Hatcher: our constitution requires 7 Elders

        320.

AC Cheryl: are there provisions if there’s not 7?

        321.

Chief Hatcher: we’ve run into this before; Judge Bernie said we needed all 7 to make a decision

        322.

AC Cheryl: Becky resigned as CoE

        323.

Chief Dan retired

        324.

CoC  Susan: Donna lives out there

        325.

Donna: yes, as well as Jimmy, grandkids, Gaylen (spelling?)

        326.

Chief Hatcher: the only one that matters is Donna

        327.

Chief Hatcher: if anyone gets hurt on that land, we’re liable

        328.

CoC  Susan: Council, what are your thoughts?

        329.

Donna: my family has lived there since 1999; I understand Chief Hatcher wants to get out of it because of insurance

        330.

Chief Hatcher: have the Elders meet to discuss it

        331.

CoC  Susan: we need to talk more; discuss it online

        332.

CoC  Susan: continue the discussion with the Elders and Donna

        333.

CoC  Susan: the papers say “and their heirs”

        334.

AC Cheryl: it’s a conditional life estate, not a will where it transfers

        335.

Chief Hatcher: it says Jerry and Donna

        336.

CoC  Susan: I looked at the deed and it says if the tribe dissolves, the land can go to the heirs

        337.

Donna: the Deed of Corrections says “heirs”

        338.

The only one who has a right to the land is Donna

        339.

AC Cheryl: we need to give them a trespassing notice

        340.

No liability by the owner for trespassers

        341.

Chief Hatcher: they were raised there

        342.

AC Cheryl: it needs to be resolved; they are not legally on the land; need an assumption of liability

        343.

AC Cheryl: they are essentially trespassing

        344.

Chief Hatcher: I think if someone gets hurt there, we’re liable

        345.

Chief Hatcher: example- they have a party with 5 people there

        346.

AC Cheryl: the first clause says you can’t sublet, rent, or allow another to live there

        347.

Chief Hatcher: but for visiting

        348.

Donna: I’ve been there since 1999

        349.

Chief Hatcher: they were raised there

        350.

AC Cheryl: need papers to be done to update with the people staying there

        351.

I don’t want people who were raised there to be run off

        352.

It’s not about the money

        353.

Marion: insurance and liability: liability is the onlu issue brought up

        354.

Chief Hatcher: what happens if she has a party and someone gets hurt and she doesn’t have insurance?

        355.

She can invite people to a party, but she’s liable for it and needs here own insurance and waiver of liability with us

        356.

Need simple risk management

        357.

I think if she doesn’t have insurance, it comes back on us

        358.
