Members, it's that time again- look at your ID card and see if the address is correct and that it hasn't expired.

If your address is different or you haven't contacted the committee within the last year, please send Michelle (me) your new contact information (address, phone, email) to ensure you receive updates on meetings and events. This will help keep your file current.

If your ID card has expired, don't hesitate to get in touch with me (Michelle) so I can check if your membership fees are current or if your ID has changed from Active status. If your membership fees are in arrears, I can let you know the amount due to update your card based on deposits to the bank. I can also send you a hard copy of the ID renewal form.

Thanks,

Chell

Waccamaw Tribal Secretary
