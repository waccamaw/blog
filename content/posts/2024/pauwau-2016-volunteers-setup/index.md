We are always looking for volunteers for before, during and after Pauwau.  If you''re interested, contact Michelle at [[emailÂ protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

Also, on November 2nd starting at 9:00 AM, we will begin setting up for the Pauwau.  We''ve got to put out the tables, chairs, hay bales, sound system, and other things to get ready for the Pauwau.  Hope to see you at the tribal grounds on Nov. 2nd!!!
