If you plan to run for Council, we have four spots open: Rick Hudnall, John Turner, Dalton Hatcher, and Robert Benton. Please send your letter of intent by 2/29/2020. Remember, if you plan to run for Chief of Council, you must declare it. We will post the letters of intent on the website and on Facebook as well as send them by email.
