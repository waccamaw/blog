Discussion

            a. Neal: was going to cut down things & start over back there. If people help this           winter, we can do it (Donnie too)

            b. Homer: Why are revisiting something that was approved?

                        1. a 2nd Chief called for it

                        2. Homer: It's an internal issue

                        3. Constitution says 2nd Chief doesn't require external or internal status

            c. Homer: It's not part of the grounds (natural grounds- we put it there)

            d. Richia: there are animals that use that pond now

            e. Iris: mixed feelings; concerned about liability; also a nest for snakes

            f. Homer: stream was created by the Creator

            g. Chief Hatcher: reason to discuss it: people thought it was a conspiracy. I        support filling it in because if we lose a child to it, we'll regret it. More RV spots.   Tribal Council didn't do anything wrong by voting on it; you have to be here to        vote

            h. 2nd Chief Susan: fill it in and it will be several years before it can be used       (sinkhole)

            i. Chief Hatcher: first got grounds, it was wet. don't think it will be a sinkhole      long; need to make a rational decision on information we have

            j. 2nd Chief Iris: pack it well

            k. Linda: sides have to be firm too

            l. Homer: would like to know who thought it was a conspiracy

            m. Neal: 5 showed; 2 didn't & we voted on something no on agenda

            n. Richia: it was me; I was asking a question

            o. Scott: sometimes, things just happen

            p. Michelle: as far as it not being on agenda- if I don't about it, it doesn't get put             on the agenda for me to print and bring with me

            q. Dalton: a question to those who want to keep it: are you willing to sit down    with those parents if their kids die? Or testify at the court case?

            r. Chief Hatcher: This won't stop all snakes- will still be liability; during School    Day/ Pauwau. must be someone guarding pond

            s. Hank: going to need gravel base to keep sinkhole from going back

            t. 2nd Chief Susan: reason for revote: we weren't here; a lot of feelings involved.            We have a Buildings & Grounds Chair- did you talk to him before you discussed    it?

            u. Homer: Where does it say we should call Council members to vote?

            v. Voting "no" means Council wants to keep the pond:

                        1. Dalton-yes, Homer-yes, Neal-no, Richia-no, Jeanie-no, Scott-yes

                        2. Tie does not change initial vote (which was to fill in the pond)

            w. Elder Jerry: Why did Jeanie vote last month on a wheel?

                        1. Michelle: that's a formatting issue

                                    a. Secretary's Note: The first line of the minutes after the headings

                                    will be which Council members were there. Names in brackets are                                            people that were absent that voted on things online. Typically, their                                names are still called out in a meeting to let people know who                                        voted online.

            x. Linda: I think it's time we stop calling people for votes

            y. Linda: which constitution are we going by?
