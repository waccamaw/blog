From CoC Rick:

On Saturday December 16th, the Waccamaw Indian People will celebrate the 2017 Winter Solstice. Ceremonies will begin at sunrise with a fire ceremony at our Fire Circle on the Tribal Grounds. Firekeepers Robert Benton and Marion Craddock will be directing the ceremony. There will also be a noon ceremony and a closing ceremony that afternoon. All members and any guest they wish to invite are welcome. I hope to see you all there as we celebrate the change of season. I would also like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New year.

Remember what the Christmas season is for , always give back and try to make a difference in the lives of others.

Walk Softly,

Chief of Tribal Council

Ricky Hudnall
