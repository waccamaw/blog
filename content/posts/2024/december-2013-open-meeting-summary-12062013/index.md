Mark A: Bathroom Project

53.

I have been working with SC State Representative Alan Clemmons, on getting the sewer tap, he has put me in touch with the Grand Strand Water and Sewer Authority, Who has given us a price of $3630.00 per no unforeseen problems. This would include the tank and grinder pump, along with the sewer tap.

54.

I have two leads on grants that I am currently pursuing. If the grants don't work out we can continue to pursue the bathroom, bathhouse project, Grand Strand Water & Sewer will finance the connection with a down payment of $190.00, they would finance the balance over 20 years, with interest, and the payment would be less than $20.00 a month.

55.

Crescent plumbing of South Carolina LLC, Has given me a written commitment to supply all fixtures, to include, handicap toilets, sinks and showers, and to do all the work involved to plumb the bath houses free of charge.

56.

My suggestion and what I'm working on is to get a prefab storage building, 12x20 to turn into a bath house. I will keep you informed on the progress of this project.
