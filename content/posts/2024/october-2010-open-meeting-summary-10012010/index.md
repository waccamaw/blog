71.

Iris doesn’t want a book full of labels. She wants to do a mass mailing. If they don’t respond, she wants to put them on inactive status.

That doesn’t solve the problem

Look into taking application page and put directly into TRB since we have those for every member

We wouldn’t have to hunt anyone down

Buster to look into legalities
