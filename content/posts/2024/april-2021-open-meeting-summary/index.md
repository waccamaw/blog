Glenn/ 2C John: felony conviction- 7-10 years instead of 5?

      1.

Hopefully the background check (automatically shows 10 years) will uncover all wrongs and people will know about it

      3.

Dalton: ok with 7 years

      4.

VC Cheryl: background check is 10 years; a person could change in 10 years

      5.

Dalton: Some Native leaders are felons (ex: Peltier, those who defended not having the pipeline)

      6.

2C John: you could just remove it for now and add it later

        1.

Dalton: I don’t want to force it in or out, but I want people to think about it

      7.

Glenn: If it’s not in there as a check for us, do we want someone to run the tribe without it who is a felon?

      8.

Kevin D: Where I am: 7 years+ is checking to see if someone has reformed- accepted back, but watched

        1.

Any violence (except self-defense and defense of family), fraud, theft, sex offenders

        2.

Dalton: can we get a written rundown of your program requirements? (to Kevin D, VC Cheryl)

VC Cheryl: you can also spell it out in the resolution

        5.

2C John: I would eliminate it or just put in there as 7 or 10 years

        6.

They could get an exception from the tribal judge

        7.

VC Cheryl: the judge would have to say it violates something in the constitution

        8.

2C John: and just say felony; people can challenge it if it arises

      9.

Marion: motion to include background checks

        1.
