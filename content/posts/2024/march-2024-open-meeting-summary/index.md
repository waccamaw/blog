We’ve never used it

37.

Glenn: the tires probably need to be replaced

38.

Glenn: out of respect, get the opinion of the person who gave it to us

Catawba Chief asked if there was anything they could do to help

56.

Policy Letters: Susan will send copies by email and the Council can update them

57.

2C John:  tribal chief lineage requirement

58.

One article of our constitution says all members can hold office

59.

One article says under Chief that it has to be a lineal descendent

60.

Dalton: it doesn't say that

61.

2C John: give me an example

62.

Dalton: under the country’s constitution, Arnold Schwarzenegger

63.

2C John: we talk about 7 generations unborn; their children can’t be Chief

64.

In my opinion, full rights, you have the same rights as all members

65.

You can’t be a true Waccamaw

66.

If there are no lineal descendants to be Chief, you have no Chief

67.

Which isn’t covered by the constitution

68.

It wasn’t in the 2000 constitution

69.

Y’all think lineal descendants don’t have the heart of the tribe

70.

Marion: don’t we have a core foundation from the Dimery settlement? Wouldn’t it eliminate those not tracing back to the Dimery settlement?

71.

2C John: there is a percentage of lineal descendants so it is Waccamaw from Dimery

72.

Phil W: And why was that done to start with? It had to go back to recognition

73.

Dalton: it was done through a referendum in 2010

74.

Phil W: when we were told by the federal government what would happen to our tribe and without recognition, we added it

75.

2C John: can you show me where in the federal requirements that it has to be lineal

76.

I’ve looked and it’s not there

77.

I think there are things in the requirements that we won’t meet, so why not solidify it?

78.

Dalton: reread the referendum from 2010

79.

2C John: why was it added?

80.

Dalton: stated in the referendum: recognized as descendants of the Dimery settlement

81.

VC Cheryl: Santa Clara vs Pueblo cadr shows how restrictive some tribes are

82.

2C John: so we do make exceptions?

83.

VC Cheryl: yes, but this change would be far-reaching

84.

2C John: not in the state-recognized constitution

85.

Susan: we only sent 100 letters to core members

86.

You also have to look at what the CMA required for state-recognized tribes, not just our constitution

87.

2C John: then we need to have a referendum to change the constitution

88.

Elder Larry: why would you jeopardize everything just to make a point?

89.

2C John: what if there’s no lineal descendants?

90.

Dalton: then the tribe is gone; people who aren’t lineal descendants would form a group

91.

VC Cheryl: we need to build membership and engage in the community to reach them

92.

2C John: was there a Chicora tribe?

93.

Susan: yes, Chicora, Chicora-Waccamaw, Waccamaw

94.

2C John: so they couldn’t be Chief

95.

Susan: not unless they’re lineal

96.

2C Alan: Lowcountry PW next weekend

97.

Dalton: John, are you still 2C?

98.

2C John: as far as I know

99.

Dalton: well Chief nominated you to be an Elder

100.

2C John: have we pursued another bank account that accrues interest?

101.

Dalton: I will look into it this week

102.

VC Cheryl: Dr. Dillian & I are looking to apply for a catalyst grant

103.

I will work with my employer to apply for another grant

104.

Capacity Building: not structure

105.

For a better CRM system

106.

For a better way of getting money from donors

107.

Having someone work in the office full-time

108.

Organizing policy letters

109.

Leadership development

110.

Youth program

111.

I ask everyone to think about it and send suggestions

112.

Did a presentation on rematriation

113.

With foundations that help tribes

114.

Richard Turner says 400 houses are being built on the Dimery land by the Holliday family

115.

He lost the lease to farm land because a family used it for housing

116.

2C John: if you were to file a suit saying the land was Waccamaw, wouldn’t that stop the building?

117.

VC Cheryl: it would hold it up while the case was pending

118.

Susan: Chief and I went to a legislative event

119.

Hembree put $140k in the budget to help with the bathhouse project

120.

2C John: any decision on the floor in the kitchen?

121.

Elder Larry: Susan pointed out that you won’t be able to get into the cabinets turning the bar you originally wanted to

Susan motioned to close the meeting; Marion seconded.

Marion-yes, Chris-yes, Robert-yes, Emily-yes, Susan-yes, Glenn-yes, Dalton-yes

The meeting adjourned at 8:10 p.m.

Respectfully submitted by Michelle Hatcher on 3/21/2023 at 5:17 pm.
