Thanks to great weather, the Waccamaw Trail Ride turned out well Saturday. I would like to thank Clay for his efforts before, during, and after the ride. I want to thank Mr. Doug, Mrs. Jewell, and, of course, Cheyenne, for security. Our friend, Ronnie Boardwine was also a gerat asset. Thanks to anyone else who helped to make the ride a success. I will have full details at the Friday night meeting.
