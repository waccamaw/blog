The IWA luncheon has been rescheduled for Saturday, September 14th, 11:30AM-3PM, due to Hurricane Dorianâ€™s expected impact on our area this week.

All Waccamaw women are invited, as we are hosting the luncheon and getting to know the women from other tribes across the state.

Please RSVP or go to the IWA Facebook page to reply.

Thank you.

Vice Chief Cheryl Cail
