To all but especially Native Americans:

The US Census is hiring! Contact them at 1-855-JOB-2020 or online at [https://2020census.gov/en/jobs](http://2020census.gov/en/jobs). Flexible hours, weekly paychecks, paid training, mileage reimbursement. Positions available: recruiting assistants, clerk, office operations supervisor, census field supervisor, enumerator/lister.

I understand that the hourly rate will be from $12 to $17 in SouthCarolina. In North Carolina, it's $12 to $20 and hour.

I don't know the requirements or anything so please call them
