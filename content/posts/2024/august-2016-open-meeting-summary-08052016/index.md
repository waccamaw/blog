60.

Dalton-yes, Homer-yes, Robert-yes, Susan-yes, Mark-yes, Rick-yes

61.

Chief Hatcher to send letter to notify him

62.

Constitution: Dalton

63.

Concerns of core v non-core

64.

Current constitution, 2 positions require you to be core

65.

Proposed constitution, 2 positions require you to be core

66.

Before the proposed constitution, there have been plenty of non-core CoC

67.

With the proposed constitution, the CoC steps into the Chief position & both are elected positions

68.

John: reason for the change is 2nd Chief isn’t an elected position, not a popular vote

69.

Elder Hank: 2 different areas of government; concern that the same thing as before will happen again

70.

Dalton: need to figure out if any position needs to be core. If not, it’s no different structurally; otherwise, you have to make sure the next position is core

71.

Chief Hatcher: Sticking with Chief position for moment, Chief has to be core; it doesn’t make sense to have someone with no ties to the tribe running it; not in favor of CoC being core. The first 2nd Chief has to be core and take over Chief position (like a VP)

72.

Dalton: the logic for that would be Speaker of House (take over VP spot)- CoC

73.

Rick: don’t think you need to be any nationality to run for office

74.

2nd Chief Phil: understand Dalton’s point; I feel like I’m always having to prove I’m Native American, despite being Waccamaw, Cherokee, probably Catawba

75.

Chief Hatcher: would like to see CoC as elected position

76.

John: also know lots of core who don’t have a vested interest; could vet them

77.

Dalton: no; they have to be elected

78.

John: approve them to be elected

79.

Dalton: there needs to be a separation of powers

80.

Rick: problem with core thing is that it limits leadership

81.

John: general populous should have right to vote for non-core

82.

Rick: what if non-core member has been an asset for 20years? What makes you think they will turn?

83.

Susan: tribe based on Dimery settlement. Why would we want an outsider to be the leader?

84.

John: you want the best person capable of leading the tribe to lead the tribe

85.

Elder Hank: still think Chief should be able to appoint 2nd Chiefs

86.

Elder Dan: if he’s (non-core) on the ballot, what happens?

87.

Dalton: he can be on the ballot for Council, just not CoC

88.

Chief Hatcher: how many think Chief should be core? Non-core?

89.

Motion based on audience & vote require Chief to be descendant of Dimery settlement; Susan seconded

90.

Dalton-abstain, Homer-yes, Robert-abstain, Susan-yes, Mark-yes, John-no, Rick-no

91.

Chief hatcher: how many think core CoC should take Chief spot should he get ill, quit, etc?

92.

Motion that first 2nd Chief take over should Chief get ill, quit, etc; Susan seconded

93.

Dalton: for that purpose, have Chief announce his Vice Chief up front

94.

Vice Chief and two 2nd Chiefs appointed (instead of 3)

95.

Motion that Chief and first 2nd Chief run as a team; Mark seconded

96.

97.

 Chief Hatcher: now anyone can run as CoC

98.

Elder Doug: don’t changes have to be ratified?

99.

100.

John: don’t we have to delineate the line of succession?

101.
