# COVID-19 Testing on Waccamaw Tribal Grounds

**4 days until August 18th**!

From Chief Hatcher:

Tanakahey y'all:

Just a reminder. We will do a free to the public, [#Covid19](https://www.waccamaw.org/updates/hashtags/Covid19) test on the 18th of August from 8 am until 11 am on our tribal grounds.

That's Tuesday, one week from today, if you get this on Tuesday the 11th of August.

I have only a couple of volunteers. I may need more but we won't be in the swabbing or recording part of it.

As I understand it, all our people will be doing is directing the cars through the site.

Wear a mask, show up on the grounds at 7:30 AM and we'll get it done.

Send this out and post as you can and will.

If you want to be tested, show up about 8 am and follow instructions from the volunteers.

If you are good at making signs, please make a few with arrows pointing and the words "Free Covid Test" .

Please let me know if you want to help.
