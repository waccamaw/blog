26.

Resolution: DH-04-06-2018-001 Subject: Exemption of membership fees for age, length of service, or large donations: Third Reading

27.

John T: disagree with this; eliminating all of these people means the Pauwau is our only income

28.

Dalton: membership fees originally were a way to get non-contributing people to contribute; items 3-7 are people who already contribute

29.

John T: we already have a hardship form system; illness doesn’t equate to poverty

30.

Susan: you also have to look at all of the time we’re here for meetings and events when other people aren’t; you can’t tell people you don’t appreciate them

31.

Dalton: I don’t think that’s what JOhn T’s saying

32.

Susan: I don’t receive much from the military myself

33.

John T: it’s a different philosophy of life then; I’ll pay the $4.65/  month and come to events anyway

34.

Dalton: if you knock items 1-2 off, do you have a problem with the rest? It would turn into a reward system

35.

John T: I could live with it

36.

Chief: I agree with John T; it’s not so much the money; it’s the volunteering

37.

John T: it’s not volunteering; membership fees are the business

38.

Chief it turns into the same thing

39.

Dalton: most of these can already be done; items 1-2 are not

40.

Chief: we need to set standards: like being a registered voter

41.

John T: would vote yes of you change it to hardship-based with majority of tribal council vote

42.

Mark: using what state?

2C Cheryl: use federal
