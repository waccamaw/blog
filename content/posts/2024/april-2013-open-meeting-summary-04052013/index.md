                                    a. they'd be able to attend meetings for 1 year to decide if they want to stay

                                    b. they could work the dollar amount off or Council could decide the                                         person didn't have to pay it for 1 year

                        3. 2nd Chief Cheryl: monthly would be difficult for people to remember to pay                           fees

                        4. Audience: $5 per month is fine (about same as cigarette/ drink prices)
