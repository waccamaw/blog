With the following exceptions, the Tribal meetings are held on the first Friday of each month at our Tribal office at 591 Bluewater Road, Aynor, SC.  The meetings will begin at 6:30 PM and will continue until the business at hand is concluded.

Due to the annual Pauwau, there is no meeting in November. Additionally, the meetings for the months of January and July are held on the second Friday rather than the first Friday of the month.'
