Reminder:

On Saturday, June 22, we will celebrate the Solstice fire.

You  are invited. I'm pretty sure there will be food but I don't know what type.

Come as you are or regalia is very welcome. Our first ceremony is at sunup, thats when we light the fire. Another ceremony is at noon. I'm not a bit sure when the closing ceremony will be. Come any time stay as long as you like.
