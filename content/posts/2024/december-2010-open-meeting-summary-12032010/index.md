•  Chief Hatcher: you're taking over feathers?

•  Brian: yes; I've got 107 beads; meeting 3rd Friday in January (3pm) to set day to make feathers

 10.Homer

 a)    Thanks to all who worked the gate

 b)    Article in The State paper

 c)    Alcohol consumption on the grounds- our grounds are hallowed

•  We decided 1 person could drink in their residence

•  I didn't see it, but heard a lot about it

•  Neal: if we catch them, we don't need to run them off- they put more people at risk. We need to put them in jail

•  Chief Hatcher and CoC Scott: it was a tent campsite behind tipis

•  Use larger signs next year

•  Dalton: two things: one- illegal to be noticeable drunk in public and two- PW is a public event. We can ask them to leave (Chief Hatcher's purview)

•  Brian: agree with Neal; We have a couple of tribal people with arrest authority

•  Chief Hatcher: agree with Homer. Problem is, it wasn't on the tent/ camping application. Problem with going to jail is that we don't have one. County will do it at $2000/ day. You can't touch them with state-certified badge.

•  Constable wasn't here for the PW

•  Elder Doug: off-duty cops?- Chief Hatcher- they have a cost per day too

•  Need a written agreement on forms

•  Question is, when does the PW start and end (each day or through the whole weekend)

•  Brian: can't get around the $2000/day?

•  Chief Hatcher: only if they break a county law and not a tribal law

•  Also dogs and pets- agreement must be enforced

 11. Chief Hatcher

 a)    Looking at business opportunities for the future

 b)    Lady trained in Management and Problem Resolution that may help us better manage the tribe

 c)    SD/ PW: not as good this year as last, but thanks to all; good job

•  Want to coordinate earlier on drum

•  Susan and Linda to give Buster names for appreciation dinner @ Ryan's on 12/11 @ 3pm

•  Secretary's Note: Changed to 12/12

 d)    Notified CMA and Secretary of State about 2010 elections results

 e)    Due a Newsletter and suggest putting Constitutional change (Richia's resolution) in there to be voted on

 f)      The State article

•  Brian: he doesn't tell people that he's a holy man. He says he's Waccamaw. He tells people that Robert is our holy man.

•  2-3 people to sit down with man and come up with resolution on 1/15

•  Brian, Homer, Scott, Dalton

 g)    Elder Doug: why do we invite certain people to the PW?
